# JcoDo

> A simple to-do list using the Vue.js framework

## Who Can Contribute?
To-do lists are everywhere these days, and for good reason; they exemplify a great learning opportunity for exploring 
various aspects of programming and -- in our case -- the Vue.js framework. However, should you feel the need to contribute to this basic project, please feel free to do so!

## What Do I Need?
In order to work on this project, you will need [NodeJS and NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) in order to install the dependencies (including Vue!) needed to build and run this project. See the instructions below for getting set up on your local machine. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
